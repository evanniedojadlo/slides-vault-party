# Deploying a HashiCorp Vault cluster in Five Minutes: The After Party

The goal of this talk is to show what you can expect after deploying a HashiCorp vault cluster. There are resources mentioning varying times of cluster deployment but the reality is that you can expect a large time investment for getting everything confidently setup.

I doodled these slides in the holiday spirit but also based them off of the 90's SkiFree game.

Here are some resources mentioned during the talk, create an issue if I missed anything:
